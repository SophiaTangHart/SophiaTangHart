- 👋 Hi, I’m Sophia Hart.

- 👀 I’m interested in machine learning and AI technologies.

- 🌱 Prior to taking a break to serve as caregiver for my young children, I worked at prestigious companies / institutions including Intel, Sandia Lab and UCSF. I have earned degrees, including 3 Master’s degrees, from top-ranked universities like Berkeley and Cornell. I recently completed my Data Science Certificate Program from Berkeley Extension with Distinction, and I was at the top of all my classes. My capstone project is entitled “Wildfire Detection
with Deep Convolutional Neural Network”. I am proactive and detailed-oriented, I value collaboration, and I am a lifelong and fast learner. I apply the experience I gain working as a scientist and engineer in industry and academia (problem solving, applying scientific method, rigorous attention to detail) in my current pursuits in machine learning and data science. 

- 💞️ I’m looking for Data Scientist, ML Eng or Data Eng role in San Francisco or remotely.
