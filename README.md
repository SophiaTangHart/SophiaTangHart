- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Sophia Hart.

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in AI/ML and data science/analytics.

- ðŸŒ± Data scientist with multidisciplinary engineering and data science education and diverse postgraduate and professional experience completing large-scale projects involving querying databases, data analytics, statistical analysis, or machine learning across healthcare, environmental science, and technology sectors. I am interested in a new role in the healthcare, environmental science, or technology sector.

In my spare time, I enjoy participating in datathon projects, creating watercolor and oil paintings (some of which you can see in the Feature section above), singing karaoke, and camping with my family.
