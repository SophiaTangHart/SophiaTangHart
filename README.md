- 👋 Hi, I’m Sophia Hart.

- 👀 I’m interested in AI/ML/DL and data science/analytics.

- 🌱 I grew up in China and immigrated to the US during high school. I overcame social-economics challenges and cultural changes, earned 3 Master's degrees and have worked at prestigious organizations. I studied Electrical Engineer and Computer Science at UC Berkeley and Biomedical Engineering at Cornell. I worked as a Research Specialist at UCSF and Circuit Design Engineer at Intel. 
- 
-   I spent a few years as a Household Manager and Childcare Provider for my young children, then I went back to school at UC Berkeley and studied Data Science, where I was awarded Distinction. Today my greatest career accomplishement includes successfully cultured human neural stem cells and imaged their development in animal brains to find treatments for human neurological diseases. 
-   
-   My expertise includes statistics, programming, machine learning, and problem-solving. I have good oral and written communication skills and enjoy working with others. In the last 3 years, I have worked on many data science projects, including a Kaggle competition on Climate Change, Wildfires Detection, and Breast Cancer Classification.
  

- 💞️ I am open to work right now. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss my qualifications further. I hope you enjoy reading my code and presentations.
