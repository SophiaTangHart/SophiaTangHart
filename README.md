- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, My name is Sophia T Hart.

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in AI/ML and data science/analytics.

- ðŸŒ± For my projects below, I've completed 4 projects in chronological order while doing my Data Science Certificate Program at UC Berkeley (Breast Cancer Classification, COVID-19 and Race, Bank Loan Risk, and Wildfires Detection).
- In the last two years, I've continued to develop my DS/ML skills by participating in Women in Data Science (WiDS) Datathon projects: Climate Change and Health Equity. Climate Change: Developed adaptation forecast using advanced machine learning in Python, XGBoost and LightGBM models; ranked top 20% of 2,000 global WiDS 2023 Datathon participants. Health Equity: Predicted total days to diagnose metastatic TNBC breast cancer using real-world data to identify patients under inequitable treatments using Python, Deep Learning, TensorFlow-Keras; ranked top 25% of 1,600 WiDS Datathon #2 participants.
