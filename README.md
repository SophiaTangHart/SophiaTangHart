- 👋 Hi, I’m Sophia Hart.

- 👀 I’m interested in machine learning and AI in biotech.

- 🌱 I specialize in Data Science/Analytics. I've previously worked at University of California San Francisco on stem cells, Intel on circuit design, and Sandia National Laboratories on mircrofabrication. I graduated from the UC Berkeley Data Science program in 2022 and was awarded Distinction. I'm looking for a role where I can use my previous expertise in biotech, combined with my new expertise in machine learning.
  

- 💞️ I look forward to the opportunity to discuss my qualifications further. Hope you enjoy reading my code and presentations.
