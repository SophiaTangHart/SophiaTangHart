- 👋 Hi, I’m Sophia Hart.

- 👀 I’m interested in machine learning and AI technologies. I hope to be a data scientist.

- 🌱 These were some of the projects I did during my Data Science Certification at UC Berkeley Extension. I've worked at UCSF, Intel, Sandia National Laboratoires, and earned 3 Master's degrees. After taking a career break to serve as caregiver for my young children, I did my certification to prepare me to return to Tech. I had very positive experience learning updated technologies, working on interesting projects, solving problems through coding, and regaining my confidence because I finished with Distinction. I would like to keep working on projects and coding, and keep adding exciting projects to my Github.     

- 💞️ I would like to hear any feedback you may have for me. Thank you.

- 📫 You can reach me at sophia.t.hart@gmail.com
